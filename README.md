# DevOps Lab: Integrating Rollbar into a Node.js Application

## Overview
This DevOps lab demonstrates how to integrate Rollbar, a real-time error monitoring and debugging tool, into a Node.js application. Rollbar helps to track, report, and analyze errors, exceptions, and warnings in your application, allowing for faster and more efficient debugging.

In this lab, we will build a Node.js application using Express, deploy it to AWS EC2, and link it to a Rollbar account. We will then expand the error handling by creating custom Rollbar errors and warnings. Additionally, we will test the application both locally and on the deployed site to ensure Rollbar error reporting is functioning correctly.

## Step 1: Build Node.js Application and Deploy to AWS EC2
1. Create a Node.js application using Express and ensure it's working correctly locally.
2. Deploy the Node.js application to AWS EC2. Ensure the application is accessible on the public IP or domain.

## Step 2: Link Rollbar Account to Your Repo
1. Sign in to your Rollbar account (https://rollbar.com).
2. Create a new project for your Node.js application.
3. Choose "Manual Setup" as the project type.
4. Select your version control system (e.g., GitHub) and link your repository to Rollbar.

## Step 3: Import Rollbar and Set It Up in Your Node.js Application
1. Install the Rollbar package using npm in your Node.js application.
2. Import Rollbar into your application's main file (e.g., `app.js` or `index.js`) and create a new instance using your Rollbar access token.
3. Use Rollbar as middleware in your application to automatically capture errors.
4. Add your application routes and middleware as needed.

## Step 4: Expand Error Handling with Custom Rollbar Errors
1. Create a custom critical error and a warning in your Node.js application to test Rollbar's error levels.
2. Test the critical error and warning endpoints locally to ensure they report correctly to Rollbar.

## Step 5: Build Out New Features and Test Rollbar Error Reporting
1. Add new features to your Node.js application and include proper error handling using Rollbar.
2. Test the application locally with the new features and verify that Rollbar is reporting errors and warnings.
3. Commit changes to your repository and redeploy the application to AWS EC2.
4. Test the new features on the deployed site, checking the Rollbar dashboard for error reports.

## Step 6: Finalize and Submit
1. Ensure that all features and Rollbar error handling are working as expected.
2. Push the final changes to your Git repository.
3. Complete the lab and submit the required documentation.

## Additional Notes
- Rollbar provides detailed error reports, including stack traces, environment information, and request data, to help debug issues effectively.
- Regularly monitor the Rollbar dashboard to proactively address errors in your application.
- For production deployments, consider using a process manager like PM2 and a reverse proxy like Nginx for better application management and security.
